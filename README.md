<center><h1>Why are Type Guards Necessary? <br> Discuss Various Types of Type Guards and Their Use Cases.</h1></center>

Static typing in TypeScript makes code safer and clearer,
but type guards are needed to work with union types and complicated objects. 
Type guards let TypeScript understand and narrow down types while the program is running.
This lets you safely do certain things based on the type of a variable.

## Why Type Guards Are Necessary

Type guards help:
1. **Narrow Union Types:** Type guards figure out the exact type of a variable that can be more than one type.
2. **Prevent Runtime Errors:** They ensure only valid operations are performed.
3. **Improve Type Inference:** TypeScript makes code safer by improving type inference.
